# COSMIC CODE COMPLEXITY CONCEPTS

## Introduction

The CoSMIC concepts were first introduced together by Dave Farley in his book
“Modern Software Engineering” (2021) as a sensible and comprehensive set of
ideas used to manage code complexity.  
They are:

- ***Co***hesion
- ***S***eparation of Concerns
- ***M***odularity
- ***I***nformation Hiding / Abstraction
- ***C***oupling

They were presented in different order, and without acronym.  
The acronym was proposed by the `DevOps Craftsman` for the first time on patreon the 7/24/2023.
