# Introduction

The CoSMIC concepts were first introduced by Dave Farley in his book
“Modern Software Engineering” (2021) as a way to manage code complexity.
They are:

- ***Co***hesion
- ***S***eparation of Concerns
- ***M***odularity
- ***I***nformation Hiding / Abstraction
- ***C***oupling

They were presented in another order, and without acronym.  
The acronym was proposed by the `DevOps Craftsman` for the first time on patreon the 7/24/2023.


## Spelling

Here is the proposed ways to spell it:

1. COSMIC
2. CoSMIC
3. CºSMIC (masculine ordinal)
4. CₒSMIC (indice notation)
5. CᴏSMIC (small capital)

The `1` and `2` should be always accepted for the matter of simplicity.  
But the others (specially `3`) are cool candidates for an official and flashy spelling!
