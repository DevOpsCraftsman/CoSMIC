# COSMIC CODE COMPLEXITY CONCEPTS

## Introduction

The CoSMIC concepts were first introduced together as whole by Dave Farley in his book
“Modern Software Engineering” (2021), even though each concept separately has been well-known
and established for a long time.  
The goal was to give a sensible and comprehensive set of ideas to manage code complexity.

They are:

- ***Co***hesion
- ***S***eparation of Concerns
- ***M***odularity
- ***I***nformation Hiding / Abstraction
- ***C***oupling

They were presented in different a order, and without acronym.  
The acronym was proposed by the `DevOps Craftsman` for the first time on patreon the 7/24/2023.
