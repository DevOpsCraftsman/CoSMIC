## Specificities of each

### SOLID

- more prescriptive
- more concrete
- easier to apply
- narrower scope

### COSMIC

- less prescriptive
- more abstract
- needs more skill to apply
- more general

This has been confirmed by a tweet of Robert C. Martin saying:

> The SOLID principles are journeyman level concepts. Beginners donâ€™t have the context to understand the problems, let alone the solutions.
> 
> On the other hand beginners should be taught that there are more advanced things coming for them to learn.
