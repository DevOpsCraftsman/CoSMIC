# SOLID VS COSMIC

## Introduction

The 2 set of guidelines are not mutually exclusive. It is even possible on some case
that following either of the 2 will produce a very similar code structure.  
The main diffirences resides in the focus and granularity.

## Specificities of each

### SOLID

- more prescriptive
- more concrete
- easier to apply
- narrower scope
- more rigid
- more opinionated

### COSMIC

- less prescriptive
- more abstract
- needs more skill to apply
- more general
- more flexible
- less opinionated

This has been confirmed by a tweet of Robert C. Martin saying:

> The SOLID principles are journeyman level concepts. Beginners donâ€™t have the context to understand the problems, let alone the solutions.
> 
> On the other hand beginners should be taught that there are more advanced things coming for them to learn.

## Relationship

SOLID principles can be seen as specific applications of COSMIC concepts.


### Single Responsibility Principle

- Modularity
- High Cohesion

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Modularity
- Abstraction
- Low Coupling

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Separation of Concerns
- Modularity
- Low Coupling
- High Cohesion

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- Modularity
