# Why another acronym?

The number of acronyms in the field is consequent, and new ones are reguraly added.  
As an example, on coding design principles and guidelines alone, we can mention:

- SOLID
- DRY
- KISS
- YAGNI
- SLAP
- GRASP
- …

If that so, a legimate question that can be asked here is:

## Do we really need another one?

Well, maybe yes, maybe not… Ultimately, it is for you –the community– to decide.  
The test of time will tell if a new acronym was worth it or not.

On the other hand, instead of being constently reluctant to any new acronym,
a good strategy may simply be to curate and filter them, and select the ones that
have the highest value for you.

Here is a proposition of guidelines that can help identify the intersting ones:

### Useful and actionable
We want to be able to use the principles in our day-to-day work, to resolve our 
problems and improve our code in a visible way.

### Simple
It has to be easy to understand and memorize. We don’t want it to increase the
cognitive load.

### Stands on the shoulder of giants
Lot of wisdom and expertise has been gather through decades in the industry.
Things have been expiremented and refined. An acronym doesn’t need to bring
something completly new, it can just gather old things, or build upon them.

### Not a hype
If it’s probable that it will disappear as quickly as it appeared, it’s definitly
not a good candidate.
