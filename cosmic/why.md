# Why another acronym?

The number of acronyms in the field is consequent, and new ones are reguraly added.  
As an example, on coding design principles and guidelines, we can mention:

- SOLID
- DRY
- KISS
- YAGNI
- SLAP
- GRASP
- …

If that so, a legimate question we can ask here is:

##### Do we really need another one?

Well, maybe yes, maybe not, it it for the community to decide…  
The test of time will tell if an acronym was worth it or not.

But, a good strategy, instead of being reluctant to any new acronyms,
may simply be to maintain a curate and filter them.

Here is a proposition of guidelines that can helps identify the intersting ones:

#### Useful and actionable
We want to be able to use the principles in our day-to-day work, to resolve our 
problems and improve our code in a visible way.

#### Simple
It has to be easy to understand and memorize. We don’t want it to augment the
cognitive load.

#### Not a hype
If it’s probable that it will disappear as quickly as it appeared, it’s definitly
not a good candidate.

#### Stands on the shoulder of giants
Lot of wisdom and expertise…
