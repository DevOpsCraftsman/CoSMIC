## Basic Example

Letâ€™s say we have a class Timer like this:

<%= @samples[0] %>

If we were told to add a suspend functionnality, it would be a bad
idea to implement it in a separate file like this:

<%= @samples[1] %>

There is a big probality that, if the 2 other functionnality of the
timer change, this third will need to be updated too.  
So, we better have to put them altogether:

<%= @samples[2] %>

Same thing without using a class; if `Timer` was just some sort of
simple data structure, we would have placed the 3 functions in a single file:

<%= @samples[3] %>
