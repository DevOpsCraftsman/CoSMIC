### Target customers:
1. juniors
1. teachers / tech coaches
1. Devs not 100% satisfied with SOLID, but loving good engineering practices
1. Devs always trying to improve skills with new ideas
1. Devs not understanding the values of concepts like SOLID

---

### Underserved needs
1. Daily work not aligned with classical SOLID examples 
1. More freedom and creativity
1. Go to the essential
1. Complete the vision about "why should we do that?" (goals VS tricks)

---

*UX layer*: code samples  
*Feature Set*: the CoSMIC concepts themselves

---

### Must have
1. complete & self-contained set of guidelines

### Performance 
1. simpler to grasp and present (not necessary to apply)
1. more generic
1. gives more freedom for implementation
1. can apply directly at the architecture level, not only code level

### Delight 
1. the name "CoSMIC", which sounds cool!
1. back to the origins, much older concepts (from the 70’s)
